Hey! 


I try to tell you our situation in Italy.

The first thing is we have to take it seriously, it's better to prevent that "to cry" after. This is my third week at home, and we can go outside only for going to the supermarket, pharmacy or for some emergencies. It's a bit frustrating because we are used to do a lot of things, to work all day, to go outside for not thinking about our problems, for relaxing, for sharing our life with friends, for everything. It's also frustrating because I choose to respect the laws for this epidemic for taking care of me and other people but I'm not the only one that live on this earth so it's only all about common sense. It's not easy to think that all of us have to or can do "personal sacrifices". 

Another important aspect is the emotional one because if we are not able to control our emotions or we are not used to work on them this situation will be more hard and for this I think that the figure of psychologist will be very important. My flat mate is a psychologist and a lot of patients wrote her to stop the psychological meetings, but she is trying to find another solution because it's very important not to leave alone these people with their feelings. 

All of us are scared and it's good because this virus is dangerous, but we have not to fall into psychosis (so we have not to buy all the supermarket because we are scared to run out of food). e have to understand that after this emergency we'll need time to "return" to normal life and we have to know that all won't be like before; we'll change ourselves and our life, so we have to use this time for thinking about it and finding solutions. We can use this time for knowing more ourselves, for finding new ways to do things, for improving our creativity or finding new talent, for changing our work or our way of working, for meditating or spending time for ourselves; we can discover a new humanity and help the weakest.

In reality we can do a lot of things at home… We have only to change the perspective or our way to live. During all this weeks I had a lot of time for thinking (and I love to think) and I questioned myself a lot:

-  We aren't really ready to the change, it's really hard to leave temporarily (3/4 months) our habits or question them… We are very open to everything in our normal life but when the emotions come we lose this skill.

-  Why do we wait until last minute for doing something? Many times, we see the problem but until it touches us closely we do nothing (including me sometimes).

-  I saw a lot of people that are not able to stay at home: it's as if they thought they had value only through others or their work... We are afraid of silence, emptiness…

- Obviously, I'm afraid to "lose" my job because the consequences for our economy will be heavy especially in our sector (art, music, dance, theater etc.). A lot of shows, rehearsals, events, residences were delated, and we lost a lot of money.

- Our health system is in trouble for the large number of people who need treatment. 
I don't want to be alarming, sorry, but I think it could be important to prevent the problem before it grows further. 

Anyway I'm good. :-) I'm enjoying my own time, I'm reading, training, watching movies/documentaries, thinking a lot, using my imagination, improving myself, relaxing, sleeping, breathing, meditating..

I know that it's not easy for everyone, but we can do it 

Hope all is going well there Carlito!

Sorry again for the long message.

Have a nice day. :-)
