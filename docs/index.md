# Introduction (Very briefly) {#chap: intro}

My name is Carlos Alcala, a.k.a Carlito Fluito. Now, a member of *the.corona.guys*. As any of us, I had plans for March and April. Travelling, visit some friends in different countries… However, I am locked down in Berlin.

The moon looks beautiful though. 

It is the first time in human history that we are living a situation like this. We have never have access to the current level of digital communication, and likely, none of us have never face a pandemic of the dimensions of the current situation. Globalization has made the Covid_19 to expand and spread with a speed and width that couldn’t have been possible before airplanes, just 70 years ago. Therefore, this is not a problem of countries, or people, this is a crisis of all of us humankind, a bunch of talking apes stuck into a rock in a planet somewhere in the universe. 

Crisis are opportunities. If we collaborate, develop a sense of global communitarianism, and behave properly, Covid_19 may enter history for being the trigger that made the specie survive as a whole and reverse the apocalyptic tendency that human behavior was creating. 

The apocalypse didn’t arrive with Covid_19, the apocalypses was coming already. Covid_19 is just a wonderful opportunity to re-order our hierarchy of values and connect back with our true nature, what we really are: talking apes trying to understand each other.  

Let’s use this opportunity to realize that an alternative system is possible. A system where we are living guided by our needs and a communal feeling of helping each other, taking care of each other. 

The sky is beautifully blue in Berlin. The moon moved, the planet moved.

## This guide {##sec: guide}
This guide is a document that will be in constant update. Therefore, whatever suggestion you have, please, contact [*the.corona.guys*](mailto: the.corona.guys@gmail.com), and we’ll do our best to make modifications, and add valuable information. 

The guide is envisioned to offer some advice and a strategy for not only surviving but thriving out of the current situation. I have biases. As a European that is locked down at Berlin, I have been raised in an individualizing mindset, surrounded by material wealth, high levels of comfort and security, and within a stablish government that cares for human rights. We are the lucky ones in the world. Many other people are in conditions way worse than us. Remain grateful. 

By the end of the guide, you should know, what to do and how to respond to the first days of the lock down, how to make it as difficult as possible to the virus, how to organize in small groups, learning communication and negotiation skills, so you can avoid conflicts in stressful situations, where you can get informed without panicking, and how you can use this huge opportunity to thrive as a human being and as Sapiens. 

The more people can read this guide, the faster we’ll move to a more promising outcome for all of us; and the faster we’ll change the situation not only in the short-term during and after the lockdown; but also, years and years beyond, where we remember the Covid_19 as the beginning of a more sustainable and humane way of living in planet earth. 

## The set up  {-##sec: setup}

This is a whole new situation for many of us. Stress response is commonly divided in three groups: fight, flight, or paralyze. Physically fighting is not possible, because viruses are not threats, we can harm and attack with our bodies. Flight is making lots of people travel to their countries of origins, to stay with families and beloved, which is increasing the risk of propagation of the pandemic. Ironically, this paralyzing situation where many of us are in, it is the most effective way of fighting. 

We have to change fear for love. The current paralysis can become in a huge leap forwards if we take this new communitarian approach to the situation.
