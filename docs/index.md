# Introduction (Very briefly) {-#chap: intro}
My name is Carlos Alcala, a.k.a Carlito Fluito. Now, a member of *the.corona.guys*. As any of us, I had plans for March and April. Travelling, visit some friends in different countries… However, I am locked down in Berlin. 
The moon looks beautiful though. 
It is the first time in human history that we are living a situation like this. We have never have access to the current level of digital communication, and likely, none of us have never face a pandemic of the dimensions of the current situation. Globablization has made the Covid_19 to expand and spread with a speed and width that couldn’t have been possible before airplanes, just 70 years ago. Therefore, this is not a problem of countries, or people, this is a crisis of all of us humankind, a bunch of talking apes stuck into a rock in a planet somewhere in the universe. 
Crisis are opportunities. If we collaborate, develop a sense of global communitarianism, and behave properly, Covid_19 may enter history for being the trigger that made the specie survive as a whole and reverse the apocalyptic tendency that human behavior was creating. 
The apocalipsis didn’t arrive with Covid_19, the apocalipsis was coming already. Covid_19 is just a wonderful opportunity to re-order our hierarchy of values and connect back with our true nature, what we really are: talking apes tryuing to understand each other. 
Let’s use this opportunity to realize that an alternative system is possible. A system where we are living guided by our needs and a communal feeling of helping each other, taking care of each other. 
The sky is beautifully blue in Berlin. The moon moved, the planet moved.
