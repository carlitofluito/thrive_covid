Carlito Fluito from the.corona.guys 2020-03-14 1 Introduction (Very briefly) {-#chap: intro} My name is Carlos Alcala, a.k.a Carlito Fluito. Now, a member of the.corona.guys. As any of us, I had plans for March and April. Travelling, visit some friends in different countries… However, I am locked down in Berlin. The moon looks beautiful though. It is the first time in human history that we are living a situation like this. We have never have access to the current level of digital communication, and likely, none of us have never face a pandemic of the dimensions of the current situation. Globablization has made the Covid_19 to expand and spread with a speed and width that couldn’t have been possible before airplanes, just 70 years ago. Therefore, this is not a problem of countries, or people, this is a crisis of all of us humankind, a bunch of talking apes stuck into a rock in a planet somewhere in the universe. Crisis are opportunities. If we collaborate, develop a sense of global communitarianism, and behave properly, Covid_19 may enter history for being the trigger that made the specie survive as a whole and reverse the apocalyptic tendency that human behavior was creating. The apocalipsis didn’t arrive with Covid_19, the apocalipsis was coming already. Covid_19 is just a wonderful opportunity to re-order our hierarchy of values and connect back with our true nature, what we really are: talking apes tryuing to understand each other. Let’s use this opportunity to realize that an alternative system is possible. A system where we are living guided by our needs and a communal feeling of helping each other, taking care of each other. The sky is beautifully blue in Berlin. The moon moved, the planet moved. 1.1 This guide {-##sec: guide} 1.2 The set up {-##sec: setup} 1.3 The goal {-##sec: goal} "],

I had just met Elias, Abdul, Csilla, and Lily. They were fine, they were okay. The type of participants I may expect in an Erasmus exchange: not super extrovert, and more on the passive side of the spectrum. Quite normal people. Actually, it is me the weird one that is super energetic (hyper-active), that comes up with socializing games and conversation topics from the first moment. However, when I went out of the restaurant and I saw you, obviously, the first thing the horny asshole thought about was: “Wow, some cute blondies.” My joy was increased a bit more by the fact that one of them seemed as crazy, spontaneous, and funny as me. We said “hi”, and to have an excuse for showing off my body skills and help my unfocused memory to remember your names, I proposed playing “reaction time” using your names. Marion wasn’t much in the mood of playing, Karolina was adjusting to the situation, but you were already full mode. I liked you. We could talk and understand each other, at least at this playful level. Mila and Igor arrived, but didn’t play. Few minutes later, we realized that everyone was on the door of the association. We joined them. We went for a sandwich and I almost influence you enough to go vegetarian the rest of the week. You chose chicken. I didn’t blame you. Now, I am thinking about how I tried to save all those sandwiches that for sure they are moldy and decomposing right now somewhere in France. I didn’t want to blame you for your choices. The same with the cigarettes. I didn’t want to be annoying from the very beginning. Even less with the person that seemed I was matching the most. I did a couple of jokes here and there with the other participants. But I still had you on my mind. I was lucky enough to find you seated alone on the bus, smiling, almost like waiting for me. It was an easy decision to sit next to you. We talked about basics and not so basics. Well, it was me the one that talked the most. I told you some of my anecdotes, some of the official and unofficial things that I was doing with my life. I told you that my social energy could switch easily from praised to unacceptable. I became vulnerable to you, showing who I was. But it felt really good, really nice. I had been working on my fear of rejection during the previous months, and by then was already neutralized. Also, I had been working on my honesty and genuineness. I had been learning that truth beats lies. I had experienced that playing was a short-term strategy with ambiguous results. However, years of meeting people and observing the results of the interactions had told me what to say and what not to say. So, I avoided certain topics, and facilitate others. You also talked about yourself, you told me about your artistic interest and success. You told me about your emotions and goals. I was a bit surprised everything was going so smooth, so easy, so spontaneous and genuine. At some point, Sonia mentioned the possibility of me moving to the other house which would have changed my whole experience. I changed my future, and later on because of the guilt of my selfish choice, I changed the future of many others. We continued talking. You just liked to listen to me, I just liked to talk. We were the perfect couple. For some moment, I even thought about coming up with a excuse for kissing you in the bus, but I preferred to be patient. “We may see tonight, or tomorrow, I don’t know, but it has been a pleasure to meet you”. I entered the hostel for the first time. Check the basics: the floor, where to stretch, where to train… Finding the room took me a while, and it served as an excuse to explore the venue. I was already thinking about where’s and when’s. I asked around like a stupid whether I could wash my clothes in a washing machine. People took me as a weird disorganized guy, which I partly was. I fooled around for a bit and then, the universe, life, destiny, (maybe you?) gave me the perfect opportunity. You were alone, under a tree, in the darkness. You were probably not waiting for me, but I have learnt that opportunities must be taken. I came to you, feeling a bit nervous, excited because of the fantastic chance that I had been given. Parts of my mind were telling me those “what if’s” that often mess up my behavior, thoughts and emotions. “What if I fucked up now”. But you asked me about hugging trees, I asked you about massage, then I asked you about kissing you, and you turned your face around, said “Oohh!” with that cute intonation, and offered me your lips. I took them. “Nice way of starting a project”, you said I felt much more secure. I didn’t have the boastfulness and macho attitude that I could have had on the past by kissing a girl the first night, the first hours of a project. I was feeling more peaceful, more natural. More like if it was the appropriate and normal things to do in a relationship that was evolving faster than normal, but with a sound and solid tempo. We had meet each other, talked to each other, showed that we liked each other, and a manifestation of affection and sexual attraction was the following step. I just did it. The day before leaving, you told me that it was too fast to kiss on the first night. I answered you that if I wouldn’t have done it, you may have changed your mind about me, you may have discovered that my intensity was too big, or that you liked more someone else. Those were my fears, and those have been the lessons of years, that have told me that kissing early is better than not kissing at all. I felt much more secure after our mouths encountered each other, still with the realization on mind that a kiss was just a kiss and that you might found whoever else at any other moment of the project. As in life, nothing is safe, nothing is sure, and nothing is for granted. But I felt good, I feel safe, I felt secure. I washed my clothes while you were drinking and then we spend the night talking and laughing with Tiberiu, Holly, Osama, Elias, and maybe a few others. I saw you talking with Humut for a couple of times, thinking that he might match physically more with you more than me. But I left those thoughts aside. I listened for the first time one of your weirdness that might spark rejection on normal people: your affinity to cockroaches. On my head, I had some surprised thoughts about your strange uniqueness, that made me undersatnd a bit more the marks that your “cat” had left on your forearms. But who was I to consider weird another person, when we are all weird, and I was probably one of the weirdest there? I loved myself. You looked like you loved yourself. I thought that it didn’t matter much whether you liked cockroaches, or moutons if we were going to be together only for ten days,. During the night, I took a couple of tiny opportunities to kiss you before separating and going to sleep. I was happy, I was excited. I had had an incredibly funny night listening to Tiberiu’s and Holly’s jokes. Avoiding a direct confrontation with the negative attitude of Holly and having kissed the girl that I liked the most, the one I had connected so genuinely with. I took my duvet, spread it on the floor, lied down, put my meditation on my earbuds, send some love to the planet and fall sleep. "],

I did a couple of jokes here and there with the other participants. But I still had you on my mind. I was lucky enough to find you seated alone on the bus, smiling, almost like waiting for me. It was an easy decision to sit next to you. We talked about basics and not so basics. Well, it was me the one that talked the most. I told you some of my anecdotes, some of the official and unofficial things that I was doing with my life. I told you that my social energy could switch easily from praised to unacceptable. I became vulnerable to you, showing who I was. But it felt really good, really nice. I had been working on my fear of rejection during the previous months, and by then was already neutralized. Also, I had been working on my honesty and genuineness. I had been learning that truth beats lies. I had experienced that playing was a short-term strategy with ambiguous results. However, years of meeting people and observing the results of the interactions had told me what to say and what not to say. So, I avoided certain topics, and facilitate others. You also talked about yourself, you told me about your artistic interest and success. You told me about your emotions and goals. I was a bit surprised everything was going so smooth, so easy, so spontaneous and genuine. At some point, Sonia mentioned the possibility of me moving to the other house which would have changed my whole experience. I changed my future, and later on because of the guilt of my selfish choice, I changed the future of many others. We continued talking. You just liked to listen to me, I just liked to talk. We were the perfect couple. For some moment, I even thought about coming up with a excuse for kissing you in the bus, but I preferred to be patient. “We may see tonight, or tomorrow, I don’t know, but it has been a pleasure to meet you”. I entered the hostel for the first time. Check the basics: the floor, where to stretch, where to train… Finding the room took me a while, and it served as an excuse to explore the venue. I was already thinking about where’s and when’s. I asked around like a stupid whether I could wash my clothes in a washing machine. People took me as a weird disorganized guy, which I partly was. I fooled around for a bit and then, the universe, life, destiny, (maybe you?) gave me the perfect opportunity. You were alone, under a tree, in the darkness. You were probably not waiting for me, but I have learnt that opportunities must be taken. I came to you, feeling a bit nervous, excited because of the fantastic chance that I had been given. Parts of my mind were telling me those “what if’s” that often mess up my behavior, thoughts and emotions. “What if I fucked up now”. But you asked me about hugging trees, I asked you about massage, then I asked you about kissing you, and you turned your face around, said “Oohh!” with that cute intonation, and offered me your lips. I took them. “Nice way of starting a project”, you said I felt much more secure. I didn’t have the boastfulness and macho attitude that I could have had on the past by kissing a girl the first night, the first hours of a project. I was feeling more peaceful, more natural. More like if it was the appropriate and normal things to do in a relationship that was evolving faster than normal, but with a sound and solid tempo. We had meet each other, talked to each other, showed that we liked each other, and a manifestation of affection and sexual attraction was the following step. I just did it. The day before leaving, you told me that it was too fast to kiss on the first night. I answered you that if I wouldn’t have done it, you may have changed your mind about me, you may have discovered that my intensity was too big, or that you liked more someone else. Those were my fears, and those have been the lessons of years, that have told me that kissing early is better than not kissing at all. I felt much more secure after our mouths encountered each other, still with the realization on mind that a kiss was just a kiss and that you might found whoever else at any other moment of the project. As in life, nothing is safe, nothing is sure, and nothing is for granted. But I felt good, I feel safe, I felt secure. I washed my clothes while you were drinking and then we spend the night talking and laughing with Tiberiu, Holly, Osama, Elias, and maybe a few others. I saw you talking with Humut for a couple of times, thinking that he might match physically more with you more than me. But I left those thoughts aside. I listened for the first time one of your weirdness that might spark rejection on normal people: your affinity to cockroaches. On my head, I had some surprised thoughts about your strange uniqueness, that made me undersatnd a bit more the marks that your “cat” had left on your forearms. But who was I to consider weird another person, when we are all weird, and I was probably one of the weirdest there? I loved myself. You looked like you loved yourself. I thought that it didn’t matter much whether you liked cockroaches, or moutons if we were going to be together only for ten days,. During the night, I took a couple of tiny opportunities to kiss you before separating and going to sleep. I was happy, I was excited. I had had an incredibly funny night listening to Tiberiu’s and Holly’s jokes. Avoiding a direct confrontation with the negative attitude of Holly and having kissed the girl that I liked the most, the one I had connected so genuinely with. I took my duvet, spread it on the floor, lied down, put my meditation on my earbuds, send some love to the planet and fall sleep. "]
