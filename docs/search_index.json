Carlito Fluito from the.corona.guys 2020-03-18 Preface Corona times require corona measures. the.corona.guys My name is Carlos Alcala, a.k.a Carlito Fluito. Now, a member of the.corona.guys. Like many of us, I had plans for March and April. Traveling, visiting some friends in different countries… However, now I am locked down in Berlin. The moon looks beautiful though. It is the first time in human history that we are living a situation like this. We have never had access to the current level of digital communication, and we have also never faced a pandemic of the dimensions of the current situation. Globalization has made the Covid_19 spread with speed and effectiveness that couldn’t have been possible before airplanes, just 70 years ago. Therefore, this is not a problem only effecting specific countries or individuals, this is a crisis regarding all of humankind; a bunch of talking apes stuck on a rock in a planet somewhere in the universe. A crisis is an opportunity. If we collaborate, develop a sense of global communitarianism, and behave properly, Covid_19 may enter history for being the trigger point that made our species survive as a whole and reversed the apocalyptic tendencies that human behavior was creating. The apocalypse didn’t arrive with Covid_19, the apocalypse was coming already. Covid_19 is just a wonderful opportunity to restructure our hierarchy of values and connect back to our true nature, what we really are; talking apes trying to understand each other. Let’s use this opportunity to realize that an alternative system is possible. A system where we are living guided by our needs and a communal urge to help and take care of each other. The sky is beautifully blue in Berlin. The moon moved, the planet moved. This guide This guide is a document that will be in constant update. Therefore, whatever suggestion you have, please, contact the.corona.guys, and we’ll do our best to make modifications, and add valuable information. The guide is envisioned to offer some advice and a strategy for not only surviving but thriving out of the current situation. I have biases. As a European that is locked down at Berlin, I have been raised in an individualist mindset, surrounded by material wealth, high levels of comfort and security, and within an established government that cares for human rights. We are the lucky ones in the world. Many other people are in conditions far worse than ours. Remain grateful. By the end of the guide, you should know, what to do and how to respond to the first days of the lockdown: how to make it as difficult as possible to contract the virus, how to organize in small groups, how to communicate and negotiate effectively in order to avoid conflicts in stressful situations, where to get informed without panicking, and how you can use this as a huge opportunity to thrive as a human being and as Sapiens. The more people can read this guide, the faster we’ll move to a more promising outcome for all of us; and the faster we’ll change the situation not only in the short-term during and after the lockdown; but also, years and years beyond, where we remember the Covid_19 as the beginning of a more sustainable and humane way of living on planet earth. The setup This is a whole new situation for many of us. The stress response is commonly divided into three groups: fight, flight, or paralyze. Physically fighting is not possible, because a virus is not a tangible thing we can attack corporally. Flight is making many people travel back to their countries of origin, to stay with family and beloved ones, which is unfortunately increasing the risk of propagation of the pandemic. Ironically, the paralyzing situation that many of us are in is the most effective way of fighting. We have to change fear for love. The current paralysis can become a huge leap forward if we take this new communitarian approach to the situation. The goal As you have probably heard, the goal now is to flatten the curve. Things don’t look too ugly at the moment, and we don’t want things to get uglier; however, they can. Check Tomas Pueyo’s article while I am writing the guide. You will get an idea of why it is necessary that everybody collaborates and stays at home. We don’t want to collapse the whole system. It is important that we are conscious of what is going on and what is coming. We, all of us, have to act now. Stay at home, keep reading. "],
["cohabiting.html", "1 Cohabiting 1.1 Get to know yourself 1.2 Get to know each other 1.3 Check with your neighboors", " 1 Cohabiting In our individualistic Europe we are not really use to get along with each other. We feel stress and pressure if we don’t find our “own moments” along the day, but ironically, we cannot leave our smartphones when we go to the toilet. In the current situation, it is likely that your time alone, may either get reduced or expanded. In case you live by yourself, you can likely suffer from loneliness at some point. In case you live with flat mates, and family member, you better learn how to communicate with each other effectively as soon as possible. In any case, I encourage you to get in contact with your neighbors in a safe way (2-meter distance, no physical contact, wash hands afterwards, etc…). The more social assets and resources you have around, the more access to potential help you will have in case you need it. 1.1 Get to know yourself Before venturing out to others, you better get familiar with the person you are. If you haven’t realized it yet, you are the person with whom you will spend your whole life. Getting to know oneself should be something all of us do all over our lives. However, in times of crisis, it is especially important that you put some conscious effort into getting to know the voice in your head, you habits, tendencies, moods, tempers, emotion management, coping mechanisms… Let’s take it bit by bit. 1.1.1 Get in contact with your needs Different people have different needs. Acknoledge that. In this situation, we are all force to spend whole days locked in one small place. It feels like we are caged animals. We are usually fine with being in cages, but now that it is forced, we feel trapped. Considering that our needs for fresh air, freedom of movement, and some task to do are heavily reduced, it is fundamental that we enter into contact with our needs in a healthier way. Therefore, be aware and conscious of what your body is asking for. If you need to go out because you feel trap at home, consider taking walk on the park on the sunrise, or during the night, when there is no risk of contagion. If your needs asks for human contanct and you feel lonely. Consider spending some days at a friend’s place that seems healthy and stable. Accept your needs and try to fulfill them consciously, minimizing the risks of the situation. It is not possible to go to a bar with many friends, but moving for 3 or 4 days to live with the same friend seems doable for me. With food, you can try some fasting. Intermitent fasting will make your body more efficient at metabolizing food and it can make your food last longer without negative consequences for you in case things get really, really angry. But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves yet, and let’s talk about current situations. 1.1.2 Chronotypes Your chronotype is the rhythm of your brain along the day. If you feel more awake in the morning, you are and early bird. If you are more awake in the evening, you are an owl.1 This is quite important if you are going to share the same space with people with different chronotype than yours. Some people get up filled of energy, some others are angry and slowly until midday. Be aware of what is your case, and understand the differences in others. You want to keep things working as smoothly as possible, thus, negotiate your own biological timings.2 1.1.3 Sleep enough Your body heals when you sleep. Now that everybody is lock down, there is not much to do. Thus, take your time and rest deeply. Lack of sleep weakens your immune system. Thus, make it difficult for the virus, use the opportunity and catch up with sleep. 1.1.4 Time alone In WEIRD cultures Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010)3 like ours, we are used to have our own private space and personal time. In more collectivistic and developing countries, the story is different. The density of population is so big that people are force to adapt their individualistic impulses to the dynamics of the group. In situations like the one we are living, it is a pretty efficient strategy to adopt a “developing country” mindset as soon as possible. We will be together, we will have to share personal and private spaces and resources, and we will be forced to collaborate and sacrifice our personal desired in favour of the collective. Anyways, if too much cohabiting gets complicate, you can set up a house rule for taking “Time alone”. My advice here is that you make it fully “Time Alone”. I am inspired in the practice of taking one day of dopamine fasting, when you are not supposed to eat, socialize, read, use your devices, etc… You can set up a 2 to 3 hours of full time alone, when one person can enter a room without any distraction or devices, so he can focus exclusively on meditating, calming themselves down, write something, exercising, or processing the situation. I also advice you to adopt the silent hour strategy. 1.1.5 Emotional management We all are going through many emotions at the moment, from fear, panic, nervousness, anger, worriness, boredom, excitement, confusion, surprise… Thus, it is fundamental that we learn how to remain calm and don’t let our emotions take control of the situation. Specially, when spending long periods of time with other people, we need to learn how to release our emotions in a safe way, avoiding aggressivity, but without letting conflicts unresolved. Some basic strategies you can already start reading and learning about are: Meditation: There is tons of resource on the internet about how to meditate and what are the benefit and impact on psychological and physical health. You can explore a post I wrote about selecting the most suitable meditaion app depending your previous experecience as meditator, from complete beginner to energy healer. Emotional intelligence: Daniel Goleman is one of the most famous author on the topic. Also, [Mayer and Salovey] are two respected authors within academia that have researched about the topic for many years. You can read and overview of the theory here. Basically, you need to train yourself in the four components of emotional intelligence: perceaving emotions, reasoning with emotions, understanding emotions, and managing your emotions. Before you get in an argument during the lockdown, breathe deeply, remember your meditation sessions, and perceive, reason, understand and manage what is going on. 1.1.6 Habits and tendencies Different people have different habits. When living together it can get problematic with your flatmates, but the first thing is to know what are your own habits, and in which self-destructive patterns you can fall. When having a lot of free time, you may binge-watch series, or spend the day without doing much, just fooling around your social media. Therefore, the earlier you stablish a series of healthy habits that keep your mind busy and growing the sooner you will enjoy your lockdown time, and the more you will take out of the situation. I write a post about it on my site, about my personal habits and how I track them. Take a look if you need some inspiration. Remember, take advantage of this situation. Imagine that you got some free days to invest in yourself, refresh your skills and upgrade your life. 1.1.7 Smartphone fear based Avoid panic mode, go airplane mode. If you are alone at your place watching conspiracy videos, it is likely that you start to get paranoid. You may also receive messages and testimonies from people at other countries, or stories about how is the situation in hospitals. In this cases, the more you use the smartphone, the worse your imagination will become. If you are lockdown at your place and you don’t have the virus, the worse thing that can happen to you is loneliness and boredom. If you are alone and you develop sympthoms, then wait few days before heading to the hospitals. It is important to give a chance to your organism to recover by yourself before collapsing healthcare system. Additionally, fear and worry will lower down your defenses making you more vulnerable to catch the disease. Thus, shut down your smartphone, or set it up in airplane mode and stablish a “time for myself” attitude. 1.1.8 Hypochondriac You may start to feel some symptoms at some point. Don’t get hypochondriac and run to the hospitals. If you go to a hospital for mild symptomathology, if you don’t have the virus, you will get it there waiting in emergency. Therefore, try to stay at home, breathe in, breathe out, treat yourself specially good for a couple of days, and wait patiently to see how your situation evolves. If you are young, you may go through the COVID-19 with ease: bit of fever, runny nose, diharrea, and cough. Obviously, if you get worse (short of breathe, high fever), it is probably time to go to the hospital. However, try to not get panic for nothing. The more you read about the symptoms, the more your mirror neurons will fire, and the more you brain will remember how many times you sneeze in the last 4 hours. Relax. If you started the lockdown on times, chances are that you are safe. Also, it is important to know that catching the virus is not cool, it is dangerous. A health worker made a video where he asks Spanish youth to stay at home and avoid collapsing hospitals for weak symptoms. He implies that some people just go there to “check” if they have the virus to post it on their social media. Please, don’t be stupid. Stay at home, avoid collapsing the hospitals, and spend your time continuing reading this guide. 1.1.9 Be creative, keep yourself busy Use the opportunity to delve in your own creativity. Check the book The artist way by Julia Cameron Cameron (2016). In this book, you will find a series of creative exercises and self-exploration that will keep you busy exploring your own creativity during the lockdown. Also, use the occasion to think outside of the box. Creativity sparks with limitations. Creativity is based on new connections of old elements. Now, that you cannot escape your room, take the opportunity of mixing things up, came up with new ideas, and use develop that artistic passion that you never could. 1.1.10 Make a schedule You need to keep yourself organized. Jordan Peterson mentions the duality between chaos and order in their works Maps of meaning Peterson (1999) and 12 Rules for life Peterson (2018). When there is too much chaos in one’s life, psyches collapse. When they have too much order, people need to fly away. In our current situation, it can happen both at the same time. There is too much new chaos in our lives because our plans for March and April got cancelled, and at the same time there is too much order because we cannot escape the environment where we are trapped in. Therefore, try to find a balance in between. Use the chaos opportunity to put order and establish a schedule of your day to day of quarantine and use the ordered environment to explore the inner chaos of your psyche, your room, and maybe ending up ordering the world a bit more. Furthermore, having and following a schedule will serve as an anchor and guide through your days of quarantine. It is very easy to stop doing things, fall into self-destructive patterns, over-sleeping, compulsive video-gaming, binge-watching, and ending up with a worse life than before. However, if you organize yourself, make a morning routine connecting with your body, your mind, and your long-term working strategy, the quarantine period can become an unforgettable moment of thriving and upgrade of your current life. Use it wisely. 1.1.11 Drop individualism Even if you are alone at home, you should stop thinking as an individual. Here in Europe, we are use to have our own personal time and space, but the current circumstances are asking for something different. Think of yourself as a piece of a huge mechanism. Whatever you do will have an effect on the whole system. Therefore, follow security guidelines, stay at home, avoid hospitals as much as possible, and try to help your flat mates and your neighbors. Contrary to what apocalyptic artwork suggest, human beings behave at their best in the worst situations. This brings the best of human nature. The cooperation, kindness, responsibility, solidarity, altruism, and generosity that makes us the ruling specie in the planet. Don’t enter into fear, and let the panic take rule of the situation. Don’t fight over toilet paper on the supermarket and think whether the resources you are taking can help other person more than you. Help those in need. If you have grandparent, or elderly in your proximity, offer them shopping and cleaning their house. Keep them as safe as possible. We will survive this all together. Focus on the love, focus on the cooperation, and drop fear, egoism, and individualism. 1.2 Get to know each other 1.2.1 Extremelly needed communication 1.2.1.1 Straight forwardness 1.2.1.2 Assume good will and be cooperative 1.2.1.3 Be empathetic 1.2.2 Express your needs 1.2.2.1 Time alone No smartphone (Dopamine fasting) 1.2.3 Be kind 1.2.3.1 Be helpful, prosocial, altruist 1.2.3.2 Respect each other processes 1.2.4 Negotiation 1.2.4.1 Norms and rules for smooth collaboration Levels of order ** Silent hour** Security word 1.3 Check with your neighboors 1.3.1 Make initial contact 1.3.2 Help them with shooping, errands 1.3.3 Avoid isolating elderly References "],

["testimonies-1.html", "6 Testimonies 6.1 Patients 6.2 Lockdown", " 6 Testimonies Here there are some selection of people that shared their experience either suffering the virus, or that have been lockdown for a long period of time and can enlighten us with ther experience. Read them and make up your mind. 6.1 Patients 6.2 Lockdown 6.2.1 Michelapriuli Hey! I try to tell you our situation in Italy. The first thing is we have to take it seriously, it’s better to prevent that “to cry” after. This is my third week at home, and we can go outside only for going to the supermarket, pharmacy or for some emergencies. It’s a bit frustrating because we are used to do a lot of things, to work all day, to go outside for not thinking about our problems, for relaxing, for sharing our life with friends, for everything. It’s also frustrating because I choose to respect the laws for this epidemic for taking care of me and other people but I’m not the only one that live on this earth so it’s only all about common sense. It’s not easy to think that all of us have to or can do “personal sacrifices”. Another important aspect is the emotional one because if we are not able to control our emotions or we are not used to work on them this situation will be more hard and for this I think that the figure of psychologist will be very important. My flat mate is a psychologist and a lot of patients wrote her to stop the psychological meetings, but she is trying to find another solution because it’s very important not to leave alone these people with their feelings. All of us are scared and it’s good because this virus is dangerous, but we have not to fall into psychosis (so we have not to buy all the supermarket because we are scared to run out of food). e have to understand that after this emergency we’ll need time to “return” to normal life and we have to know that all won’t be like before; we’ll change ourselves and our life, so we have to use this time for thinking about it and finding solutions. We can use this time for knowing more ourselves, for finding new ways to do things, for improving our creativity or finding new talent, for changing our work or our way of working, for meditating or spending time for ourselves; we can discover a new humanity and help the weakest. In reality we can do a lot of things at home… We have only to change the perspective or our way to live. During all this weeks I had a lot of time for thinking (and I love to think) and I questioned myself a lot: We aren’t really ready to the change, it’s really hard to leave temporarily (3/4 months) our habits or question them… We are very open to everything in our normal life but when the emotions come we lose this skill. Why do we wait until last minute for doing something? Many times, we see the problem but until it touches us closely we do nothing (including me sometimes). I saw a lot of people that are not able to stay at home: it’s as if they thought they had value only through others or their work… We are afraid of silence, emptiness… Obviously, I’m afraid to “lose” my job because the consequences for our economy will be heavy especially in our sector (art, music, dance, theater etc.). A lot of shows, rehearsals, events, residences were delated, and we lost a lot of money. Our health system is in trouble for the large number of people who need treatment. I don’t want to be alarming, sorry, but I think it could be important to prevent the problem before it grows further. Anyway I’m good. :-) I’m enjoying my own time, I’m reading, training, watching movies/documentaries, thinking a lot, using my imagination, improving myself, relaxing, sleeping, breathing, meditating.. I know that it’s not easy for everyone, but we can do it Hope all is going well there Carlito! Sorry again for the long message. Have a nice day. :-) "],
